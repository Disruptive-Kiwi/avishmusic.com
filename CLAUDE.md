## Claude Instructions

### Before Starting ANY Task
1. Ask all open/unresolved questions first
2. Clarify ambiguous requirements
3. Don't assume - ask

### Before Building Big Features
Web research the latest docs for our stack (React, Vite, Tailwind v4, etc). Don't assume training cutoff knowledge is current - APIs and best practices change.

### Grug Brain Principles
- Simple > clever
- Less code > more code
- Obvious > elegant
- Delete > comment out
- Fix root cause > patch symptoms

### Frontend Work
Use **frontend-design skill** (`.claude/skills/frontend-design.md`) for all UI work. Hook auto-triggers on frontend file edits.

Key rules:
- Bold aesthetic, not generic AI slop
- Distinctive typography (no Inter/Roboto/Arial)
- Dominant colors + sharp accents
- NEVER purple gradients on white
